#BokChat server

###Currently, it only serves as a simple irc server, I plan to expand it to accept other protocols as well.
(under development)



To compile the program, simply type 
```
make
```


To run the program, type
```
./rlhsu_server -i 6667
```
where the number after -i specifies the port number to listen to
